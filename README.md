# restaurant-page

This project is to practice what I have learnt on The Odin Project (TOP).

Skills consist of:
- HTML and CSS
- Webpack
- Modules
- Javascript 

The aim is to use JS to produce a webpage who's elements are generated and deleted through JS, thus changing pages while still being on the same URL
